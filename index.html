          <legend> My coding journey </legend>
          I've been coding since 2014. Started with C++ and thought it would conquer the world as it's the only
          language that has it all. That never happened. Then I met JavaScript in sixth semester of my college.
          Didn't thought much of it and yet now I'm writing client application, backend server application
          and even executable scripts for Linux using QuickJs in JavaScript. <br>
          So, now I truly believe JavaScript will be, and already is, the jack of all trade that I'd hoped C++ to
          become.
          As the infamous saying goes, "Everything that can be written in js, will be written in js."

          <legend> My hobbies </legend>
          Apart from tech, I'm always on a side quest of understanding something new that I
          didn't before. This side quest has taken me to the realms of philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science, as
          I believe there are only two real mysteries left in the world.
          <br>First, the world itself and second is our own
          mind, and I think we are much closer to solving the latter than the former.

          <legend> My education </legend>
          I started as an average student; studying was boring until around seventh or eighth standard when I got an
          awesome math teacher who showed how fun mathematics really is. After that, getting a good grip on math, other
          subjects
          started becoming interesting, mainly physics. It was fun because it gave answers to questions that I never
          even
          consciously articulated to myself but always had in the back of my mind. <br>
          I thought of pursuing it for higher studies, but that field demands a "marathon effort" to actually get some
          worthwhile results, which was unsuitable for my impatiently curious mind. Enter 'Computer Science and
          programming in C++' in my eleventh standard. It was the perfect cocktail to satiate my ravenous curiosity,
          which craved a creative outlet for the mind. Ever since those days, I'm hooked on the world of programming and
          computer science.
