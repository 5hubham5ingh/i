            <legend> My coding journey </legend>
            I've been coding since 2014. Started with C++ and thought it would conquer the world as it's the only
            language that has it all. That never happened. Then I met JavaScript in sixth semester of my college.
            Didn't thought much of it and yet now I'm writing client application, backend server application
            and even executable scripts for Linux using QuickJs in JavaScript. <br>
            So, now I truly believe JavaScript will be, and already is, the jack of all trade that I'd hoped C++ to
            become.
            As the infamous saying goes, "Everything that can be written in js, will be written in js."

            <legend> My hobbies </legend>
            Apart from tech, I'm always on a side quest of understanding something new that I
            didn't before. This side quest has taken me to the realms of philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science,
            as
            I believe there are only two real mysteries left in the world.
            <br>First, the world itself and second is our own
            mind, and I think we are much closer to solving the latter than the former.

            <legend> My education </legend>
            I started as an average student; studying was boring until around seventh or eighth standard when I got an
            awesome math teacher who showed how fun mathematics really is. After that, getting a good grip on math,
            other
            subjects
            started becoming interesting, mainly physics. It was fun because it gave answers to questions that I never
            even
            consciously articulated to myself but always had in the back of my mind. <br>
            I thought of pursuing it for higher studies, but that field demands a "marathon effort" to actually get some
            worthwhile results, which was unsuitable for my impatiently curious mind. Enter 'Computer Science and
            programming in C++' in my eleventh standard. It was the perfect cocktail to satiate my ravenously impatient
            curiosity,
            which craved a creative outlet for the mind. Ever since those days, I'm hooked on the world of programming
            and
            computer science.

            The process involves two choices: generating invoices with predefined designs or editing designs.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the first option, users select a predefined design, and the system fetches this design from the
            database.
            It combines the design with invoice data, generates HTML, and allows the user to view or download the
            invoice.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second choice involves design editing. Users open a design editor, and a template design is created
            using
            default JSON. Users customize the design with real-time previews, save their changes as the new default JSON
            in the database when satisfied.

            The Data Validation Worker receives the file and data validation function. The flow: Excel file is split
            into sheets, Schema Validation Worker checks them concurrently. Sheets then go for data validation based on
            schema results.
          </li>
          <li>
            After Data Validation, data is categorized as 'Valid Data' or 'Invalid Data.' Valid data is stored in the
            database, while invalid data is returned to the client app for correction by the user. The corrected data
            goes through
            validation again.
